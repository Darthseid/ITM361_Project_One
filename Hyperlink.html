  <p> <q> You respect what a person can do for you. You fear what a person can do to you. </q> </p>
  <p> <q>If I lived my life the way my mother wanted me to, I would be a multimillionaire with a mansion and a yacht. 
    If I lived my life the way my preacher wanted me to, I would be engaged and in a seminary. If I lived my life the way my boss wanted
    me to, I would wash dishes forever. If I lived my life the way my cousins wanted me to, I would own a massive video game collection.</q>	</p>
  
  <p> <q>the IRS cannot tax friendships. Thieves cannot steal your connections away from you. </q> </p>
  
  <p>  <q>There are only two types of fashion in America, clothes only women wear, and clothes everyone wears. </q>	</p>
  
  <p>  <q> The more wealth you have, the less people care where you're from. </q> </p>
